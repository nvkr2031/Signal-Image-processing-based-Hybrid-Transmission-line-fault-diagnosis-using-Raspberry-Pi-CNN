VGG16: A CLASSIC CNN ARCHITECTURE

VGG16 is a renowned convolutional neural network architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image recognition. It employs a straightforward architecture with 16 convolutional layers and small 3x3 filters, demonstrating impressive performance in image classification tasks.

APPLICATIONS:

VGG16's simplicity and ease of implementation make it a popular choice for educational purposes and as a baseline model for benchmarking new architectures.

INSULATOR FAULT DETECTION:

The text states that the trained VGG16 model, implemented within a Jupyter Notebook environment, will be used to classify insulator images into three categories:

BROKEN INSULATOR: Identifies images where the insulator is physically damaged or broken.

FLASHOVER INSULATOR: Detects images of insulators experiencing electrical discharge (flashover).

GOOD INSULATOR: Classifies images of insulators in normal, healthy condition.
