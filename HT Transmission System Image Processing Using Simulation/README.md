This section explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – ResNet50, EfficientNet, and VGG16 – for fault detection in high-voltage transmission lines. These models are trained and evaluated using a labeled image dataset within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The trained models are then used to classify images of insulators as either "good" or "faulty" (e.g., broken, flashover).
