This section explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – ResNet50, EfficientNet, and VGG16 – for fault detection in high-voltage transmission lines. These models are trained and evaluated using a labeled image dataset within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The trained models are then used to classify images of insulators as either "good" or "faulty" (e.g., broken, flashover).

The simulation results for image processing show that deep learning models like ResNet50, EfficientNet, and VGG16 effectively detect faults in high-tension insulators, achieving accuracy rates above 90%. The performance metrics, including F1 scores and precision, demonstrate their reliability in identifying faults. Graphs illustrate the models' strengths and consistent performance across various scenarios. Overall, these advanced techniques enhance fault detection and support proactive maintenance in power transmission systems.
