A DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE

DEPTH: ResNet50 boasts a 50-layer deep neural network, which theoretically allows it to learn complex representations from images.


RESIDUAL CONNECTIONS: To overcome the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks, ResNet50 incorporates "skip connections." These connections allow information to bypass some layers, enabling the network to learn residual functions and improve gradient flow.

FEATURE EXTRACTION: ResNet50 effectively extracts hierarchical features from images through its convolutional layers.

APPLICATIONS: Excels in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.

APPLICATION IN INSULATOR FAULT DETECTION

The trained ResNet50 model, implemented within a Jupyter Notebook environment, will be used to classify insulator images into three categories:

BROKEN INSULATOR: Identifies images where the insulator is physically damaged or broken.

FLASHOVER INSULATOR: Detects images of insulators experiencing electrical discharge (flashover).

GOOD INSULATOR: Classifies images of insulators in normal, healthy condition.
