A DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURE

DEPTH: ResNet50 boasts a 50-layer deep neural network, which theoretically allows it to learn complex representations from images.


RESIDUAL CONNECTIONS: To overcome the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks, ResNet50 incorporates "skip connections." These connections allow information to bypass some layers, enabling the network to learn residual functions and improve gradient flow.

FEATURE EXTRACTION: ResNet50 effectively extracts hierarchical features from images through its convolutional layers.

APPLICATIONS: Excels in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.

APPLICATION IN INSULATOR FAULT DETECTION

The trained ResNet50 model, implemented within a Jupyter Notebook environment, will be used to classify insulator images into three categories:

BROKEN INSULATOR: Identifies images where the insulator is physically damaged or broken.

FLASHOVER INSULATOR: Detects images of insulators experiencing electrical discharge (flashover).

GOOD INSULATOR: Classifies images of insulators in normal, healthy condition.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS : 

ACCURACY: The ResNet50 model exhibits a positive trend in accuracy across training epochs, as shown in Fig. 3.3. Both training and validation accuracies steadily increase, indicating that the model is effectively learning from the dataset and improving its performance over time.

LOSS: Concurrently, Fig. 3.4 demonstrates a consistent reduction in the model's loss during training. This suggests robust optimization and enhanced predictive capabilities.

ROC CURVE ANALYSIS: Fig. 3.5 presents the multi-class ROC curve, which highlights the model's strong discriminative power. High AUC values for each fault type confirm this:

BROKEN INSULATOR: AUC = 0.99

FLASHOVER DAMAGED INSULATOR: AUC = 0.95

GOOD INSULATOR: AUC = 0.91

Collectively, these results affirm the ResNet50 model's effectiveness in accurately classifying insulator faults. The high accuracy, consistent loss reduction, and strong AUC values suggest that ResNet50 is a suitable candidate for deployment in real-world fault diagnosis systems for power transmission lines.
