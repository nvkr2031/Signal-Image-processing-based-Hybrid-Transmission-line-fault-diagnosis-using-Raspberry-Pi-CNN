# Signal & Image processing based Enhanced Hybrid Transmission line fault diagnosis using Raspberry Pi & CNN
Developed a hybrid fault diagnosis system for power transmission lines utilizing Raspberry Pi and deep learning techniques to enhance fault detection and improve maintenance efficiency.
Transmission lines are crucial for electricity distribution, and insulators play a vital role in their integrity. However, faults like breakage, flashover, and tracking can compromise their performance. Traditional manual inspections are time-consuming and prone to errors. This research proposes a hybrid system combining signal and image processing with deep learning models (ResNet50, EfficientNet, VGG16) for real-time fault detection in high-tension insulators. This automated approach aims to enhance accuracy, enable early fault detection, and improve the reliability and efficiency of power transmission networks.
